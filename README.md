# LabVIEW 24-hour clock
## Description
In this project, a 24-hour clock is made through the use of integrated circuits of basic logic gates such as AND, NOT and OR, as well as seven-segment displays to represent hours, minutes and seconds. The simulation of this project is carried out in the National Instruments LbVIEW software.
